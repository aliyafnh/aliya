          <h2 class="h2">Where this thought started</h2>
          <p class="p">
            I once read a line that stayed with me longer than I expected:
            <span class="em">“Teach your heart to accept disappointment even from people you love.”</span>
          And it hit me in a quiet way,&nbsp; not dramatic, just true. </p>
          <p class="p">
            Because disappointment doesn’t always come from strangers or enemies.
            Sometimes it comes from people who actually care about you,&nbsp; people who mean well,
          people you love, people who love you back. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="block reveal">
          <h2 class="h2">Expectations vs reality</h2>
          <p class="p">
            I think a lot of disappointment happens when reality refuses to match the version we rehearsed in our heads.
            The outcome we imagined. The effort we expected. The response we thought was “obvious.”
          </p>
          <p class="p">
            But the truth is: they’re human. And I’m human too.
            Love doesn’t magically delete miscommunication. It doesn’t remove blind spots.
            It doesn’t guarantee that people will always show up the way we want them to.
          </p>

          <div class="pull reveal">
            <p>
              Disappointment doesn’t always mean they don’t love you.
              Sometimes it means they’re limited, and you’re learning.
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="block reveal">
          <h2 class="h2">The shift that helped me</h2>
          <p class="p">
            I had a moment where something didn’t happen the way I wanted,&nbsp; not the way I expected ,and I felt that familiar heaviness. But when I sat with it, I realized: <span class="em">not everything will unfold exactly the way I pictured it.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="p">
            And that sentence didn’t make me “okay” instantly ,it just made me calmer.
            It helped me stop fighting reality and start meeting it.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="block reveal">
          <h2 class="h2">If you’re disappointed right now</h2>
          <p class="p">
            If you’re feeling disappointed  by a partner, a colleague, a friend, or even family ,I just want you to know: it’s okay.
          </p>
          <p class="p">
            You don’t have to pretend it didn’t hurt. You also don’t have to turn it into a war.
            Sometimes the strongest thing you can do is accept what happened,
            take your lesson, and move with patience.
          </p>
          <p class="p">
            I’m not saying I’m naturally patient ,I’m not. But I’m learning
            and maybe sharing this helps you learn too.
