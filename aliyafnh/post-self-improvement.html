          <h2 class="h2">Discipline over motivation</h2>
          <p>
            Motivation comes and goes. Discipline stays.
            The version of me I’m proud of wasn’t built on feelings,
            it was built on structure, boundaries, and consistency.

          <h2 class="h2">Growth is uncomfortable by design</h2>
          <p>
            If it feels awkward, lonely, or unfamiliar,
            it usually means you’re doing something new.
            Comfort is not proof of progress.

          <p>
            I stopped asking “what could this become?”
            and started asking “what is this showing me now?”
            Reality is the most honest feedback.
